+ Add support of sending to GMail using gmailer.gem

+ Add file lock (extract from first revisions of Cerberus)
+ Add flag verbose (from command line)
+ Make possibility to run tests for all revisions (not only latest for that moment)
+ Send svn log not only for latest revision but from latest successfull. For that we need to store version of latest successful rev.
+ IRC: make message colorized. Make messages shorter to avoid irc flood (and ban to user)
+ Buildall run several threads, so if one of the projects frozen lets say on subversion lock - other will finish successfully
     Limit thread execution time for 30 minutes
