+ Add flag verbose (from command line)
+ Make possibility to run tests for all revisions (not only latest for that moment)
+ Send svn log not only for latest revision but from latest successfull. For that we need to store version of latest successful rev.
+ IRC: make message colorized. Make messages shorter to avoid irc flood (and ban to user)
