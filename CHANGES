== Version 0.2.0
Config file was changed since 0.1.1 and you need regenerate config files.
Or change it by hands: see doc/OPTIONS file to list of all avalable options.

Changing required by advanced publishing mechanism. Now it is possible to add several published to one project.

Also added 3 new publishers.
  Jabber Publisher - all notification sended via Jabber server
  IRC publisher - messages sent to IRC channel
  RSS Publisher - result of build Cerberus writes to file in RSS format.
    This feature would be useful for big open project when many users would like to see results of test-run.
    If you publish results as RSS - then any user could subscribe to channel.
