= Cerberus Changelog

== Version 0.2.0
Config file was changed since 0.1.1 and you need regenerate config file.
Changing required by advanced publishing mechanism. Now it is possible to add several published to one project.

Also appeared 2 publishers.
  Jabber Publisher - all notification sended via Jabber server
  RSS Publisher - result of build Cerberus writes to file in RSS format.
    This feature would be useful for big open project when many users would like to see results of test-run.
