Cerberus is continuous integration (CI) software. Cerberus could be periodically run from scheduler 
and check if aolication tests are broken. If it happend then Cerberus sends notification to developers.

For more CI theory read this document from Martin Fowler 
http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html.

Requirements: 
  ruby - 1.8.2 or higher
  rake - 0.7 or higher
  svn client - 1.2 or higher


What 'Cerberus' name means?
Quote from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus)

Cerberus or Kerberos (Kerberos, demon of the pit), was the hound of Hades-a monstrous three-headed dog (sometimes said to have 50 or 100 heads) with a snake for a tail and innumerable snake heads on his back.
He guarded the gate to Hades (the Greek underworld) and ensured that the dead could not leave and the living could not enter. His brother was Orthrus. He is the offspring of Echidna and Typhon.


So Cerberus will guard your tests and not allow your project to go to the world of dead.


To use Cerberus it is very easy. First install it. Easiest way to do it through RubyGems package manager.

'gem install cerberus'

then you need to add project that will be watched by Cerberus. Do it by

cerberus add (DIR|SVN_URL)?    #Adds project to list of watched applications

as second parameted you could pass URL to subversion repository or directory with working SVN folder.
If this parameted absent then would be added project from current directory

Go to ~./cerberus and edit config.yml file (only once after installing Cerberus). Enter your configuration options here
like email server, password, user_name and other options. See ActiveMailer description - Cerberus uses it as notification
layer. Mine config file looks like this
mail:
  address: mail.somesever.com
  user_name: anatol
  password: anatol
  domain: somesever.com
  authentication: login

Also go to ~/.cerberus/config/<PROJECT_NAME>.yml and add comma-separated list of recipients for this project
You could also change <PROJECT_NAME> to any other name. This name what Cerberus will use.

And then run Cerberus 

cerberus build PROJECT_NAME    #Run project

It will check out latest sources and run tests for your app. If tests are broken - recipients will recieve notifications.

But of course better run Cerberus automatically from Cron. Run it each 10 minutes for project will be ok.

Well, thats all. If you have any questions, proposals - just let me know.
