Describe what is is Cerberus. Link to Wikipedia. Cerberus don't let your project go into the world of chaos and death.


cerberus add (DIR|SVN_URL)?    #Adds current project to list of watched applications
cerberus build PROJECT_NAME    #Run project







set HOME





This is Cerberus application that help us keep application in a good shape.

It is Continues Integration software, that runs tests after each source-code change.

Just install *.gem file that i sending you and then

  cerberus add <SVN_URL>

After that in ~/.cerberus/config you will see <PROJECT>.yml config file for your application.
Edit "recipients" line in that file and add any emails where you want to send mails

Also you need to configure mail server. You need to edit ~/.cerberus/config.yml for that. This is my config content

mail:
  address: 10.159.228.243
  user_name: anatol
  password: anatol
  domain: my.mail
  authentication: login

you need add similar config file with your options.

You could check your application by running
  cerberus build <PROJECT>
but better to add cerberus invocation to Cron. Run it each 15 minutes will be ok.

Well, thats all. If you have any questions, proposals - just let me know.
