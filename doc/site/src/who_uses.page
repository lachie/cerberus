h2. Who uses

h4. "Anatol Pomozov":http://blog.pomozov.info/tags/english/ (Creator of "Cerberus":http://cerberus.rubyforge.org)

When I start using "Ruby On Rails":http://rubyonrails.com framework I became test-infected developer. 
Rails allows you to create tests for your application with exiting simplicity that it is hard not to be test-infected.

But additionally to test you I needed tool that run tests after each commit to VCS repository. It's needed to be sure that my tests
are passed cause I don't want to trap to "Broken Windows" situation.

For my Java projects I have been using CruiseControl for a long time and I would like to have similar tool for my
Rails projects. I did not find anything that match my needs and I decide to write such tool for Ruby by myself.

First version of Cerberus was implemented during weekend. And in the next version were added a lot of features requested by other users.

Now I am using Cerberus for my 8 Ruby projects and happy with it. I have schedule task 'cerberus buildall' to run each 15 minutes and if tests
are broken Cerberus would notify me about that.


h4. "Abonja":http://www.abonja.nl

At Abonja we have been using unit-tests and continuous builds for our C++
projects. Next to our C++ work we are now using Ruby on Rails for the
website. We are very happy with the fact that we can work  the same way with
Ruby on Rails as Cerberus takes care of the continuous testing.

We have Cerberus running on a separate so-called build-box. It gets the
latest commit from SVN, migrates the database and runs all the tests. All
this in just a matter of minutes. If by any chance a test fails you get a
friendly mail from Cerberus telling you who broke the build, and better yet,
when the next run is successful, it tells you who fixed it!
