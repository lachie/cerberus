When I start using "Ruby On Rails":http://rubyonrails.com framework I became test-infected developer. 
Rails allows you to create tests for your application with exiting simplicity that it is hard not to be test-infected.

But additionally to test you I needed tool that run tests after each commit to VCS repository. It's needed to be sure that my tests
are passed cause I don't want to trap to "Broken Windows" situation.

For my Java projects I have been using CruiseControl for a long time and I would like to have similar tool for my
Rails projects. I did not find anything that match my needs and I decide to write such tool for Ruby by myself.

First version of Cerberus was implemented during weekend. And in the next version were added a lot of features requested by other users.

Now I am using Cerberus for my 8 Ruby projects and happy with it. I have schedule task 'cerberus buildall' to run each 15 minutes and if tests
are broken Cerberus would notify me about that.
