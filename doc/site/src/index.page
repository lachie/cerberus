h2. Cerberus

Cerberus is Continuous Builder software. It could be periodically run from scheduler and check if application tests are broken. If it happens then Cerberus will send notification to developers. Cerberus perfectly works both on Windows and *nix platforms.

Cerberus requires: 
* "ruby":http://ruby-lang.org/en/ - 1.8.2 or higher
* "rake":http://rubyforge.org/projects/rake - 0.7 or higher
* "subversion":http://subversion.tigris.org/ client - 1.2 or higher (optional)
* "darcs":http://darcs.net/ client - 1.0.7 or higher (optional)
* "bjam":http://www.boost.org/tools/build/v2/index.html (optional)
* "perforce":http://www.perforce.com/ (optional)

h4. What 'Cerberus' name means?

Quote from "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus
bq. Cerberus or Kerberos (Kerberos, demon of the pit), was the hound of Hades-a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and innumerable snake heads on his back.
He guarded the gate to Hades (the Greek underworld) and ensured that the dead could not leave and the living could not enter. His brother was Orthrus. He is the offspring of Echidna and Typhon.

So Ruby Cerberus tool (like his ancestor) will guard your application tests and not allow your project to go to the world of dead projects.

h4. There is several solutions already present, why do you need to use Cerberus?

Main advantages of Cerberus over other solutions:
* Cerberus could be installed on any machine not only where SVN repository located.
* Cerberus works not only for Rails projects, but for any other Ruby projects (or better to say for projects that use Rake).
* Cerberus multiplatform solution: it runs excellent both on *nix and Windows.
* Cerberus distributed via RubyGems, so it is very easy to install and very easy to update to the latest available version.
* Cerberus very easy start to use. Just type @cerberus add PROJECT_URL|PROJECT_DIR@.
* Cerberus is lightweight solution: mots of the time ruby process even not run. Cerberus runs @rake@ only in case if changes in project found.

 
To use Cerberus it is very easy. First install it. RubyGems package manager is an easiest way to do it.

@gem install cerberus@

or get Cerberus distribution package right from "download page":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1794&release_id=6442

Then you need to add project that will be watched by Cerberus. Do it by

@cerberus add (DIR|SVN_URL) APPLICATION_NAME=some_app RECIPIENTS=dev1@project.com@

as second parameter you could pass URL to subversion repository or directory with working SVN folder.

Go to ~./cerberus and edit config.yml file (only once after installing Cerberus). Enter your configuration options here like email server, password, user_name and other options. See "ActiveMailer":http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html description - Cerberus uses it as default notification layer. 

Here is an example of configuration file

<pre>
publisher:
  mail:
    address: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    domain: gmail.com
    authentication: plain
    user_name: someuser
    password: somemail
</pre>

Also check ~/.cerberus/config/<APPLICATION_NAME>.yml and make sure that you have right options.

And then run Cerberus project

@cerberus build APPLICATION_NAME@

or run __all__ registered projects

@cerberus buildall@

It will check out latest sources and run tests for your application. If tests are broken - recipients will receive notifications.

But of course better run Cerberus automatically from Cron. Run Cerberus for project each 10 minutes would be ok.
