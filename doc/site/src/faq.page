h3. How to change task for Rake

__Q: In my project we need to run Rails migrations before tests. But by default Cerberus runs :default task.
How could I run migations?__

It is easy to do - just set Rake tasks option in config
<pre>
builder:
  rake:
    task: migrate test
</pre>

And it would run migrations and then tests. You could set __task__ option to any other task set.


h3. How to schedule Cerberus build on nnCron

"nnCron":http://www.nncron.ru/download/nncron191.exe is scheduling tool for Windows. It is a good replacement for Unix Cron
on Windows platform. nnCron has simple user interface and it is easy to add new scheduled task.

There is only issue - nnCron do not pass __HOME__ environment variable to process so you need to add it to nncron.tab file. 
You could add __CERBERUS_HOME__ envronment variable or __HOME__ (in last case __CERBERUS_HOME__ would be calculated as 
HOME/.cerberus)

Mine nncron.tab file looks like below

<pre>
SET CERBERUS_HOME="C:\Documents and Settings\anatol\.cerberus"
