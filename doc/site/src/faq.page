h3. How to change task for Rake

__Q: In my project we need to run Rails migrations before tests. But by default Cerberus runs :default task.
How could I run migations?__

It is easy to do - just set Rake tasks option in config
<pre>
builder:
  rake:
    task: migrate test
</pre>

And it would run migrations and then tests. You could set __task__ option to any other task set.


h3. How to schedule Cerberus build on nnCron

"nnCron":http://www.nncron.ru/download/nncron191.exe is scheduling tool for Windows. It is a good replacement for Unix Cron
on Windows platform. nnCron has simple user interface and it is easy to add new scheduled task.

There is only issue - nnCron do not pass __HOME__ environment variable to process so you need to add it to nncron.tab file. 
You could add __CERBERUS_HOME__ envronment variable or __HOME__ (in last case __CERBERUS_HOME__ would be calculated as 
HOME/.cerberus)

Mine nncron.tab file looks like below

<pre>
SET CERBERUS_HOME="C:\Documents and Settings\anatol\.cerberus"

#( cerberus
AsLoggedUser
LoadProfile
Time: */15 * * * * *
Action:
SWHide   NormalPriority
START-APPW: c:\progra~1\ruby\bin\cerberus.CMD buildall
)#
</pre>

h3. Run Cerberus from Subversion __post-commit__ hook

Subversion and like some other SCM allow to "hook action on commit":http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s02.html#svn-ch-5-sect-2.1.
And if you install Cerberus on the same box where you keep your Subversion repository you could add custom hook
to run CI tool right after user commit and do not use Cron scheduler at all.

To make it add /hooks/post-commit file with following content

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/cerberus build YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
</pre>

And do not forget to add execution permission to this file.
