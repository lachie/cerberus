* How to schedule Cerberus build on nnCron

nnCron has simple user interface and it is easy to add new task - just run task with AsLoggedUser option.
There is only issue - nnCron do not pass HOME environment variable to process so you need to add it to nncron.tab file.

You could add CERBERUS_HOME envronment variable or HOME (in last case CERBERUS_HOME would be calculated as 
HOME/.cerberus)

Mine nncron.tab file looks like this



SET CERBERUS_HOME="C:\Documents and Settings\anatol\.cerberus"

#( [cerberus]watsjit
