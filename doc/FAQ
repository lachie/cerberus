* How to schedule Cerberus build on nnCron

nnCron has simple user interface and it is easy to add new task - just run task with AsLoggedUser option.
There is only issue - nnCron do not pass HOME environment variable to process so you need to add it to nncron.tab file.

You could add CERBERUS_HOME envronment variable or HOME (in last case CERBERUS_HOME would be calculated as 
HOME/.cerberus)

Mine nncron.tab file looks like this



SET CERBERUS_HOME="C:\Documents and Settings\anatol\.cerberus"

#( [cerberus]watsjit
AsLoggedUser
Time: */15 * * * * *
Action:
SWHide   NormalPriority
START-APPW: c:\progra~1\ruby\bin\cerberus.CMD build cerberus
)#


* How to change task for Rake
In my project we need to run Rails migrations before tests. But by default Cerberus runs :default task.
How could I run migations?

it is easy - just set Rake tasks option in config
builder:
  rake:
    task: migrate test

And it would run migrations
